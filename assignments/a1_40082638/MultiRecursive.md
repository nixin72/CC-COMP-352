The multi-recursive Oddonacci method takes too long to compute for the inputs given. 
After running it for 2 1/2 hours, I stopped executing it. 

The series will continue to scale exponentially greater until at input of 100 it will take
over 1 trillion calls to execute it. 

2^5 + 2^10 + 2^15 + ... + 2^100

It's not worth attempting to calculate the time taken to compute this.
