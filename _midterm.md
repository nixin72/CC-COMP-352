1. A general tree T has n nodes and height n/2. It is possible that there is a node in the tree with n/2 children. **True.** 

2. Stack operations:

Question 2: dispute this! It was worded poorly as I thought it was the resulting stack 

Page 3 Question 3:
When the element is a position, but not a node

Page 3 Question 4: 
When the node has been deleted 

Page 4 Question 1:
Best: Omega(1), Omega(log n), Omega(n)
Worst: O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

Page 4 Question 2: 
Post-Order traversal

Page 4 Question 5:
Iterable (counter this because I wrote List<Position> since I have a C# background)
